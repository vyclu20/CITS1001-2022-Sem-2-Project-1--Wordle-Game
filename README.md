# CITS1001-2022-Sem-2-Project-1--Wordle-Game

Project was last updated on: 18 March 2023

**This was a university project for a basic java object oriented programming unit/module.**

I didn't do the unit at said semester, so this wasn't graded and I'll never know how well I did. But it passed all the tests so good practice I guess!

## Project Overview

In this project, the task was to create a simplified version of the game Wordle. The objective of the game is to guess a hidden word in a limited number of tries. In this simplified version, the guesses are not limited to dictionary words. The player is allowed to guess any string of the right length.

### There were only two classes I needed to edit: WordleGame and WordleDictionary. The TO DO's were what I had to edit.

> WordleGame: Enables the user to play a simplified version of the Wordle game. It includes several methods, namely WordleGame (the constructor), getSecretWord, isInSecretWord, and guessWord, which need to be implemented by the user.

> WordleDictionary: The mentioned class serves to store a collection of words to be used in the Wordle game. It includes methods such as WordleDictionary (the constructors), getWordsWithLength, and getRandomWord.

Only uploading the classes I needed to edit. No JUnit tests etc
